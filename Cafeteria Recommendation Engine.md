The Cafeteria Recommendation Engine is designed to provide personalized food recommendations for employees, thereby enhancing their dining experience and overall satisfaction. By collecting 
and analyzing employee feedback, ratings, and preferences, the system can suggest food items that align with individual tastes and dietary requirements. This innovative approach not only 
improves customer satisfaction but also aids chefs in tailoring their menus to better meet the collective preferences of their consumers.
